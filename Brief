You are required to build a student records system for UL (in so far as you can). UL
offers many different types of programmes, which are of varying duration, at varying
levels such as undergraduate, postgraduate and also include both taught programmes and
research programmes. Programmes are run by Departments/Schools and these
departments hold examination boards at the end of each review period to review student
progression. Students may be requested to repeat a module, link-in to modules, repeat
semester, year etcâ€¦
Your system should store student results (grades in modules each semester) and should
perform QCA calculations per semester/year/programme (and others as deemed
necessary) for the different types of programmes available in UL. The system should be
able to identify students that do not meet the minimum academic standards for
progression.
Students should be able to review their own transcript. Faculty should be able to look up
transcripts. Faculty should be able to submit results for their modules each year/semester.
Departments should be able to hold exam boards to review progression.
